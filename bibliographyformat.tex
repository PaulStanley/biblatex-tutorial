\chapter{The Bibliography}

Citations written, we come to the actual printing of the
bibliography. The magic command is:
\begin{center}
\cs{printbibliography}
\end{center}
And, for simple cases, it may even be as simple as that! But there are
quite a number of refinements.

The refinements can be classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to the way the bibliography is headed: what is it
  called? Is it treated as if it were a new chapter, or a new section?
  How is the heading printed? Is it included in the table of contents?
\item Changes to the appearance of the bibliography items: what font
  are they printed in? Are they indented? How? How much?
\item Changes to the way the bibliography is sorted.
\item Selection of the material to be printed in the bibliography: are
  all sources cited, or only some? How are they selected?
\item Provisions for creating multiple bibliographies, such as
  different bibliographies for different chapters, or different
  bibliographies for different topics.
\end{itemize}
The last two items overlap a bit, because in one sense producing
multiple biographies is a matter of selecting what works go in which
bibliography. It's simpler, however, to defer most discussion of this
to a chapter of its own. We are also going to leave sorting for a
separate discussion. So this chapter is really going to concentrate on
three points: headings, the physical format of the bibliography, and
the ways we can select material for inclusion or exclusion.

\section{Headings}

In a \LaTeX\ document, a heading is more than just its words: a heading command (such as \cs{chapter} or \cs{section}) doesn't just print its text, formatted a certain way. It may add a number, and advance a counter. It may change what gets printed in the running headers or footers.

Let's start with the actual title. A default\footnote{The default is
`Bibliography' for books and articles, and `References' for articles.} will be set by the
\verb|heading| option, described below; but by far the easiest way to
control it is using the \verb|title| option in the
\cs{printbibliography} command.

So, for instance, if we wanted to call our bibliography `List of
Sources Cited', we could
\begin{center}
\cs{printbibliography[title=\{List of Sources\}]}
\end{center}

This is fairly straightforward. Beyond that, some degree of complexity
lurks.

It's all fairly easy if you want to have the bibliography title
treated as if it were a chapter heading (for the \verb|book| and
\verb|report| classes) or a section heading (for the \verb|article|
class). This is, after all, the ordinary case, and \biblatex\ then
provides you with the following options:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \marginnote{\gives\ {\large\textbf{References}}\\(not in table of contents)}you want the heading inserted, but without any number and
  without being added to the table of contents, you're all set. This
  is what \biblatex\ will do by default.
\item If\marginnote{\gives\ {\large\textbf{References}}\\(in table of contents)} you want the heading added to the table of contents, but you
  don't want it numbered, then add the option \verb|heading=bibintoc|
  to your \cs{printbibliography} command.
\item If\marginnote{\gives\ {\large\textbf{6.\ References}}\\(in table
    of contents)}you want the heading numbered and added to the table of
  contents, then add the option \verb|heading=bibnumbered| to your
  \cs{printbibliography} command.
\end{itemize}

It's also easy enough if you want the bibliography dealt with at
\emph{one level below} the default: in other words, you want it
treated as a section (in the \verb|book| or \verb|report| classes) or
as a sub-section (in the \verb|article| class:
\begin{itemize}
\item To have just the heading (no table of contents or numbering),
  choose the option \verb|heading=subbibliography|.
\item To have the heading included in the table of contents, but not
  numbered, choose the option \verb|heading=subbibintoc|.
\item To have the heading numbered and included in the table of
  contents, choose the option \verb|heading=subbibnumbered|.
\end{itemize}

Finally (and perhaps easiest of all), if you want no heading at all,
just choose \verb|heading=none|.

These are all the options that \biblatex\ gives you by
default. Combined with \verb|title=...| (to overrride the default
titles) this will usually
suffice. If, however, you want to define a special heading for your
bibliography, you will need to proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define a bibliography heading style using
\begin{center}
  \cs[\angled{title}][\angled{definition}]{defbibheading\{\angled{name}\}}\end{center} The
  \angled{title} is the default title for your heading. The definition
  part is a complete set of commands to create a heading and anything
  (such as the marking of headers and footers, table of contents, and
  so forth) that needs to go with
  it. It takes the form of a macro definition which assumes it will be passed
  the title of the bibliography as its single paramenter, \#1.
\item Use the name of the \verb|heading| you have defined as the
  \verb|heading| option to your \cs{printbibliography} command.
\end{enumerate}

So, for instance, suppose we wanted to set up our bibliography to be
formatted as a subsection, but without any number; we also want it
added to the table of contents, and we want it to mark both recto and
verso pages. The default title is to be `Works Cited':
\begin{verbatim}
\defbibheading{myheading}[Works Cited]{%
  \subsection*{#1}%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{#1}%
  \markboth{#1}{#1}}
\end{verbatim}

There's one tiny trick to bibliography headings. It's normally best to
do all your customization in the preamble of your document, before you
(or \LaTeX) gets to \cs[document]{begin}. But for bibliography
headings (and title, and notes) it's actually safest to set them up
after \cs[document]{begin}.

\section{Bibliography Format}

The appearance of a bibliography is largely controlled by a
pre-defined bibliography environment. You can change the default by
defining a modified bibliography environment of your own, and then
passing the name of that environment as
\begin{center}
\cs{printbibliography[env=\angled{your environment}]}
\end{center}

The environment needs to be set up in advance, for that purpose, you
use the command \cs{defbibenvironment}:
\begin{center}
\ttfamily
\cs{defbibenvironment}{\angled{name}}\{\angled{start}\}\{\angled{end}\}\{\angled{per-item}\}
\end{center}

The way this works is as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[\angled{name}] is the name you choose to refer to this style of
  environment: it's what you will use with the option \texttt{env=} to
  typeset a bibliography using this environment.
\item[\angled{start}] is code to be executed at the beginning of the
  bibliography, before any entries are printed. It's customary (though
  not essential) to set a bibliography using a list environment of
  some sort, and this lets you set that up.
\item[\angled{item}] is code to be executed at the beginning of each
  \emph{entry} in the bibliography: for instance \cs{item}.
\item[\angled{end}] is code to be executed at the end of the
  bibliography, for instance to end the environment you began with
  \angled{start}.
\end{description}

Let's give a practical example. People writing CVs (resum\'es)
sometimes want to number the items while using a non-numeric
bibliography style, such as verbose or author-year. Suppose you loaded
the \verb|authoryear| style, but then defined a bibliography
environment as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\defbibenvironment{myenv}
  {\begin{enumerate}}
  {\end{enumerate}}
  {\item}
\end{verbatim}
Now, using
\begin{pseudoverb}
\cs{printbibliography}\relax[env=myenv,heading=myheading]
\end{pseudoverb}
we get
