The \textsf{biblatex-mla} style implements the style rules of the Modern Language Association. It is fundamentally an author/title style in which \verb~\autocite~ produces parenthetical citations \autocite{worman}. The title, however, is printed only where you cite more than one work by a single author. Citations in footnotes will produce full bibliographical information on the first occasion,\footcite{aristotle:poetics} though this can be changed.

The package is loaded in the usual way:
\begin{verbatim}
     \usepackage[style=mla]{biblatex}
\end{verbatim}
Since MLA is an American Style, this example uses
\begin{verbatim}
     \usepackage[american]{babel}
\end{verbatim}
to ensure the correct language file is loaded; it also loads \textsf{csquotes} with the \verb~american~ option.

\input{standardpre3.tex} I have included another work by Aristotle \parencite{aristotle:poetics}, in order to show how the MLA style prints titles (only) where more than one work by a single author has been cited.
