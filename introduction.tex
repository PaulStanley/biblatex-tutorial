\chapter{What is \package{Biblatex}?}

This chapter has two different sections, intended for different
audiences. If you are new to automated bibliography tools in \LaTeX,
then you should read the first section. If you already have experience
of using automated bibliography tools in \LaTeX, such as \bibtex\ and
\package{Natbib}, then you can probably jump straight to the second
section.

\section{For the true neophyte}

\subsection{The basic idea}

Academic writing usually cites sources. The exact form of these
citations varies: different disciplines have different practices, and
different publishers and journals too. But the underlying idea is
similar: there are references in the text (or footnotes) that enable
the reader to identify a source for a particular statement or
quotation. This could be a number in a list of references (like [1]),
or a combination of author and year (like Author 2014), or even a
footnote which identifies the source.\footnote{Like: Author, `Paper
  Title' in \emph{Learned Journal}, Vol.\ 10 (2014), p.\ 111.}
Alongside this there is a bibliography: a list of all the sources
which have been cited, which will nearly always enable the reader to
look up the source in a library, and sometimes provide (in itself)
some useful information about the source, such as its date, or where
and how it was published.

It is, of course, possible to produce all these indications entirely
`by hand': typing out references, bibliographies and so forth. But
there are disadvantages to doing that:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is time-consuming. If you write lots of papers, you will
  probably find yourself citing the same sources again and again. It's
  tedious to have to keep looking up and typing out the same data. You
  have to spend time doing things like organising your bibliography
  into the proper order.
\item It is error-prone. Every time you type data up, you risk making
  a mistake: either a mistake of substance (typing `Stanely' for
  `Stanley'), or in the way the data is formatted.
\item It can be frustrating. Each citation system has its own picky
  requirements. One wants the titles of articles in double quotes,
  ``Like this''. Another wants them in single quotes, `Like
  this'. Another wants them in italics \emph{Like this}. There are
  specialists who revel in such details: but for the average person
  they are just a nuisance, and it is nice to have a system which
  takes care of these details for you.
\item The details sometimes change as you write. For instance, if you
  use a system where references are numbered, adding a reference may
  change all the numbering. Or if you follow a system which uses
  abbreviations such as `ibid', `op.\ cit.' or references back to
  earlier notes, adding a single footnote can throw everything out. In
  such systems it's not possible to finalize references until the
  document is complete: and every change can easily introduce errors.
\end{itemize}

The idea of a citation system is to \emph{separate content from
  presentation}. You record the important details about a source in a
database file: the author(s), title, date, publisher and so forth. As
you write, you use a short reference to indicate the work you want to
cite at that point in your paper. And then you let the computer take
care of extracting the information from your database and inserting
and formatting it into your paper. And in fact, in many fields, you
can find existing databases which you can borrow from which will
contain data you need.

This is what \biblatex\ does. You maintain a database which contains
the works you may want to cite. The database can be large: it needn't
include only the works that you want to cite in a particular paper ---
it can be as large as you like. It can be in any order. All that
matters is that it contains the information that is needed to
`construct' the citations.

As you write your paper, you insert commands to tell \biblatex\ that
you want to cite particular sources drawn from that database.

Then, when you are done, as part of the compilation of your \LaTeX\
source, you get \biblatex\ to extract the relevant information, format
it, and construct the citations and bibliography in proper format.

\subsection{In practice}

In practice, getting all this to happen involves a number of different
tools and programs, which all have to work together.

You are going to start with two files:\footnote{At least two, since
  your \LaTeX\ source could \cs{include} or \cs{input} more than one
  file, and your database may consist of more than one file too.} a
database file and your \LaTeX\ source file.

The database file conventionally has the suffix \texttt{.bib}, and
consists of a set of records containing information about the sources
you may wish to cite. The format of such a file is described in
chapter \ref{ch:database}. It is a plain text file, which you can
either produce by hand (using a text editor, such as the one you use
to write \LaTeX\ source code) or can be maintained by one of a number
of available `helper' programs (which we consider in chapter []).

The \LaTeX\ source file conventionally has the suffix \texttt{.tex}
and contains all your text, marked up in \LaTeX\ format. It also
contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item A\marginnote{\cs{usepackage[style=...]\{biblatex\}}} line that
  loads \biblatex\ and tells it what `style' to use for citations and
  bibliography.
\item One\marginnote{\cs{addbibresource\{file.bib\}}} or more lines
  which tell \biblatex\ what file(s) to use as the database from which
  information is to be extracted.
\item One\marginnote{\cs{cite\{...\}}} or more commands which tell
  \biblatex\ that you want to \cs{cite} a particular source at that
  point in your text.
\item (Usually)\marginnote{\cs{printbibliography}} one or more
  commands that tell \biblatex\ to print a bibliography at that point
  in the document.
\end{itemize}

The next task is to get the various tools to cooperate together to get
to the end result that you need. In general that requires at least the
following things to happen:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \LaTeX\ first on the source file. At this point no citations
  are produced. Instead \biblatex\ \emph{records} a list of the
  sources that you have cited.
\item Run another program which reads the list that has been produced,
  analyses the database, and extracts the relevant information into a
  format that \biblatex\ can work with. There is a choice of programs
  that you might use for this, but in this handbook we will be
  assuming that you will use a program called \package{Biber}.
\item Run \LaTeX\ again, to `read in' the data that has now been put
  in digestible form, and produce the citations and bibliography.
\item (Sometimes), run \LaTeX\ yet \emph{again} to finalize cross-references.
\end{itemize}

This `pattern' (\LaTeX, \package{Biber}, \LaTeX, (\LaTeX)) is repeated
whenever you need to compile your document.\footnote{Not quite true:
  it is often unnecessary to re-run \package{Biber} if no new
  citations have been added. But it is never wrong to do so.}

\subsection{A quick demonstration\label{neophyte:example}}

Why not try a quick example? I assume for these purposes that you have
a fully-equipped and functional \TeX\ system, and have installed the
pre-requisites for \biblatex. This will be true on any of the standard
modern \TeX\ installations; but it's not a bad idea to update to at
least the most recent versions of \biblatex\ and \package{Biber},
since both are under active development.

First, let's set up our `database'. It's not going to be much: just a
single book.

Open a text editor, and produce a new file
\texttt{handbook.bib}:\intref{Much more about how to write
  \texttt{.bib} files is explained in chapter~\ref{ch:database}.}

\begin{verbatim}
@book{nussbaum:95,
  author = "Nussbaum, Martha C.",
  title = "Poetic Justice",
  subtitle = "The Literary Imagination and Public Life",
  publisher = "Beacon Press",
  location = "Boston",
  date = "1995",
}
\end{verbatim}

Now open a text editor or your \LaTeX\ editor, and create a small test
file (I'll call mine \texttt{test.tex}):\intref[1.5in]{Much more about
  \cs{cite} commands is explained in
  chapter~\ref{ch:citationcommands}.}

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage[style=numeric]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{handbook.bib}
\begin{document}

As Nussbaum comments \cite[17]{nussbaum:95}: ``The utilitarian 
picture of human beings and of rationality is familiar enough in
theory''.

\printbibliography
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

Now, run \LaTeX\ on the file, once. If you look at the resulting
typeset document, it should look something like figure
\ref{nussbaum1}.

\begin{figure}
\fbox{\includegraphics{./examples/nussbaum1u.pdf}}
\caption{Before running \package{Biber}}\label{nussbaum1}
\end{figure}

The reference `[\textbf{nussbaum:95}~]' appears in square brackets
because although \LaTeX\ can `see' that there is going to be a
citation, it doesn't yet have the data that will enable it to
construct that citation, since \package{Biber} has not been run.

Now, from a terminal window opened in the same directory, run
\begin{verbatim}
biber test
\end{verbatim}

Hopefully, you will see a number of messages marked as `INFO', ending
with \texttt{INFO -- Output to test.bbl}.

Now run \LaTeX\ again on the source file \verb|test.tex|. And if all
is going well, you should now see output like figure \ref{nussbaum2}.

\begin{figure}
\fbox{\includegraphics{./examples/nussbaum2u.pdf}}
\caption{After running \package{Biber} and \LaTeX}\label{nussbaum2}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the citation data has been pulled into the
bibliography. If the output remains unchanged (it looks like figure
\ref{nussbaum1}) that is because \package{Biber} has not successfully
run. That is \emph{probably} because there is some error in your
|.bib| file, so go back and check that. Any time you see this, you
should ask yourself these
questions:\marginnote{\textit{Debugging}\\1. \cs{addbibresource}?\\2. Run
  \LaTeX\, \package{Biber}, \LaTeX?\\3. \package{Biber} was
  error-free?\\4. Cite key is correct?\\5. \texttt{.bib} file contains
  source?\\6. Entry in \texttt{.bib} file valid?\\See
  chapter~\ref{ch:troubleshooting}.} (1) have I told \biblatex\ where
to find the bibliography file (using |\addbibresource{}|? (2) Have I
run \LaTeX\ then \package{Biber} then \LaTeX\ again? (3) Did
\package{Biber} report any errors? (4) Is my citation \emph{key}
correct (e.g., you haven't typed |nusbaum| for |nussbaum| in the
\LaTeX\ source? (5) Does the |.bib| file include that citation? (6) Is
the syntax of the citation correct?

\subsection{What next}

There is still quite a bit to learn, of course. To some extent it's up
to you how you go from here, but the following chapters take what I
think is a reasonably logical order.

\section{For the more experienced}\index{bibtex@\bibtex!compared to biblatex@compared to \biblatex|(}

From the user's perspective, the basic pattern followed by \biblatex\
is similar to the one you will be accustomed to if you use \bibtex\
with \verb|.bst| files, or citation packages such as \package{Natbib}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your bibliographical data is still stored in \verb|.bib| files,
  which have largely the same format as \bibtex\ files. (But
  \biblatex\ recognises additional entry types and fields.)
\item You still generate citation and bibliography data by running
  \LaTeX\, then an external program (either \bibtex\ itself or a more
  powerful replacement, \package{Biber}, and then \LaTeX\ again
  (sometimes twice).
\end{itemize}

There are a few, largely cosmetic, changes to the commands that you
need to include in your document to `set up' the bibliography. (See
page \pageref{bibtex:simple:eg}.)

\subsection{Differences}

So, what are the main differences?
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a big difference in the essential way in which
  \biblatex\ and traditional \bibtex-based systems work. In
  particular, in \biblatex\ the external program is used only to
  prepare data: the formatting and output of that data is largely
  handled using \LaTeX\ code, whereas in \bibtex, most of the
  formatting is done by \bibtex, producing a bibliography which is
  more-or-less ready to be typeset as it is.
\item The practical consequence of that is that \biblatex\ can do
  things that traditional \bibtex\ cannot: in particular it can
  respond \emph{dynamically} to context in a way that traditional
  \bibtex\ cannot, or cannot easily.
\item This means that \biblatex\ can be used for citation systems
  (such as traditional humanities-style systems) for which \bibtex\
  alone is unsuited. It is a more powerful and flexible system.
\item In addition, the \package{Biber} program -- which is recommended
  to replace \bibtex\ in sorting and handling the bibliographical data
  itself -- is more flexible and powerful than \bibtex\ is, and
  doesn't suffer from some of the \bibtex's historical limitations.
\end{itemize}

You may well be asking: should I use \biblatex? Most users probably
fall anto one of three groups.

Some people \emph{need} to stick with traditional \bibtex. For
instance, if you are submitting work to a journal which has a \bibtex\
style which it requires you to use, then you should \emph{not} switch
to \biblatex, at least for that paper. And if you frequently or
sometimes need to use \bibtex, you should try to keep your |.bib|
files compatible with it (for instance, continue to use |year| rather
than |date| fields).

Some people \emph{don't need} to switch. If you have existing \bibtex\
styles which work for you, and do everything you need, then there is
no reason to switch. You can. But you don't need to. The existing
programs have the advantage of stability in such cases. On the other
hand, switching will accustom you to \biblatex\ and put its more
powerful features at your disposal. It's really a matter of
taste. Those who don't have an existing heavy investment in \bibtex\
should probably prefer \biblatex. But don't make such a change a week
before you are due to submit your doctoral thesis.

Some people \emph{need} \biblatex. This is probably true if you work
in the humanities and need sophisticated and complex styles such as
traditional footnote-based citations systems, if you want to cite
non-standard sources, if you need to handle large volumes of non-ascii
characters or have complex sorting requirements, if you need to work
in multiple languages.

\subsection{The required changes}

The main differences between using \biblatex\ and `standard' \bibtex\
are as follows:\label{bibtex:simple:eg}

\begin{itemize}
\item You need to load \biblatex\ as a package using \cs{usepackage}
  (generally with various options). It's generally wise to load
  \package{csquotes} as well.
\item Instead of \cs{bibliographystyle}, you specify the style to be
  used as an option when loading \biblatex:
\begin{pseudoverb}\centering
  \cs{usepackage}[style=\ldots]\{biblatex\}
\end{pseudoverb}
\item Instead of specifying the \verb|.bib| file as an argument to the
  \cs{bibliography} command, you use the command
  \cs{addbibresource\{\}} to identify the file(s). You specify the
  file(s) to be used completely, including their \verb|.bib|
  suffixes. So if your bibliography file is called \verb|mybib.bib|,
  you have
\begin{pseudoverb}
  \centering \cs[mybib\textbf{.bib}]{addbibresource}
\end{pseudoverb}
\item Instead of \cs{bibliography}, you use \cs{printbibliography} at
  the point where the bibliography should be printed.
\end{itemize}

One important point to understand: existing \bibtex\ \emph{styles}
cannot be directly used by \biblatex.\sidenote{There is a project to
  provide \biblatex\ styles that are identical to the standard
  \bibtex\ ones: the \package{biblatex-trad} package. It has, however,
  only reached version 0.2, and does not seem to have been actively
  developed recently.}  The `standard' styles in \biblatex\ do not
precisely correspond to the standard styles in \bibtex.

\subsection{An example}

Find an existing \verb|.bib| file of your own (or, if you are pushed
to find one, make use of a standard file such as
\verb|biblatex-examples.bib|, which will be installed with \biblatex).


Try the following sample document: \clearpage
\marginnote{\tikz[overlay]{\draw (0,-0.5em) edge [out=180, in=25,
    -stealth] ([shift={(0.5ex,2.3ex)}] pic cs:csquote)}Although not
  essential, \package{csquotes} should normally be loaded.}
\marginnote[2ex]{\tikz[overlay]{\draw (0,-0.5em) edge [out=180, in=90,
    -stealth] ([shift={(-0.5ex,2.3ex)}] pic cs:style)}Style is
  specified when loading the package, not using
  \cs{bibliographystyle}.}  \marginnote[0.2ex]{\tikz[overlay]{\draw
    (0,-0.5 em) edge [out=180, in=0, -stealth] ([shift={(1.2ex,
      +1ex)}] pic cs:resource)}Instead of identifying the
  \texttt{.bib} files in the \cs{bibliography} command, they are
  identified this way.}  \marginnote[0.2ex]{\tikz[overlay]{\draw
    (0,-0.5 em) edge [out=195, in=45, -stealth] ([shift={(1.2ex,
      +1ex)}] pic cs:printbib)}Instead of \cs{bibliography},
  \cs{printbibliography} is used to print the reference list.}
\begin{pseudoverb}
\cs[article]{documentclass}\\
\colorbox{green!30}{\cs[csquotes]{usepackage}\tikzmark{csquote}}\\
\cs{usepackage}[backend=bibtex, \colorbox{red!30}{style=\tikzmark{style}numeric}]\{biblatex\}\\
\colorbox{blue!25}{\cs[biblatex-examples.bib]{addbibresource}\tikzmark{resource}}\\
\cs[document]{begin}

\cs[*]{nocite}

\colorbox{green!30}{\cs{printbibliography}\tikzmark{printbib}}

\cs[document]{end}
\end{pseudoverb}

If you run \LaTeX, \bibtex, and \LaTeX\ again, you should find that a
numbered bibliography is produced. Now see if you can get it to work
with \package{Biber}. Replace line 2 with
\begin{center}
\cs{usepackage[backend=biber, style=numeric]\{biblatex\}}
\end{center}
and delete \verb|.aux|, \verb|.bbl| and \verb|.blg| files. Now run
\LaTeX, \package{Biber} and \LaTeX\ again. You should generate the
same document. (You might also like to try the sample document
suggested for complete neophytes, which is at page
\pageref{neophyte:example}.) Although \biblatex\ can use \bibtex\ to
prepare its data, it's generally better to use \package{Biber}, which
is a more modern program with many advantages.

\subsection{The \package{Natbib} package}

Many \LaTeX\ users use the \package{Natbib} package. This is a sort of
`half-way house' between \bibtex\ and \biblatex. It's somewhat more
flexible than a pure \bibtex\ solution, and has (in particular) a
wider range of citation commands to deal with author\slash year
citation systems. But it still uses \bibtex\ under the hood, and it
doesn't have \biblatex's flexibility.\index{bibtex@\bibtex!compared to
  biblatex@compared to \biblatex|)}

Biblatex has a \package{Natbib} `compatibility mode'.%
\index{Natbib compatibility}
If you load \biblatex\ with the option \texttt{natbib} (or
\texttt{natbib\allowbreak =\allowbreak true}), then it will let you
use some \package{Natbib}-like citation commands, like \cs{citet} and
\cs{citep}. However, the ``compatibility'' is really only skin-deep;
it hardly\footnote{It does modify the punctuation used to separate an
author's name from the year to match the \package{Natbib} default.}
extends beyond the citation commands, and the actual formatting of the
citations (which will depend on the style you specify) will be
determined by \biblatex. In general, it's probably a better idea to
get used to the \biblatex\ citation commands.
